#introduction
  
  Geoglass uses three API's to find nearby places which have Wikipedia pages. The places are then shown to the user in the for of a list. 
  The first one is used to get the location of the user and then record it in variables, which will be used to find nearby pages. 
  Wikipedia has an API, WikiSearch, which uses longitude and latitude in order to make a GET request and returns wikipedia pages which are 
  near to that latitude and longitude. The web app offers the user to type in their ZIP code, and because of this, there needs to be a way 
  to convert the ZIP code to latitude and longitude so that the WikiSearch API can then be used. After doing so, the WikiSearch API then returns
  the nearby pages which are then displayed to the user in a table. 
  
#uses 

  The primary use of Geoglass is to uncover places which the user may not be aware about. One can also use it when traveling through places which
  is not familiar with and wants to find something interesting nearby. 
  
#browser compatibility

  Geoglass works best with Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. Issues may be present when letting the app get your location when using Mozilla Firefox. 
  If using Firefox, your best option is to type in your ZIP code and letting the app get your location that way.
